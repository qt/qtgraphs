    \title Graphs 2D in Qt Widgets
    \ingroup qtgraphs_examples
    \brief Using Graphs for 2D in a Widget based application.

    Graphs 2D support only Qt Quick applications. This example shows how to
    display a simple 2D pie graph in a Qt Widgets applications using a
    \l QQuickWidget.

    \section1 Main View

    \list 0
    \li The \c PieWidget class implements the main view of the demo application.
        In the \c PieWidget class, instantiate the widgets used to implement the
        application layout and UI elements.

        \snippet 2d/quickwidgetgraphs/piewidget.cpp 0
        \dots

    \li The \c PieGraph class is used to handle logic for adding and removing
        slices, and have other functionalities.

        \snippet 2d/quickwidgetgraphs/piewidget.cpp 1
        \dots

    \li For \l QQuickWidget, set \l{QQuickWidget::}{source} and
        \l{QQuickWidget::}{resizeMode}, and set the
        \c context property. The \c Context property allows data to be exposed
        to QML components instantiated by the QML engine.

    \li Initialize buttons and add them to layout.

    \section1 Manipulating Graph data

    The \c PieGraph class implements all the logic for manipulating Graph data in
    this example.

    \list 0
    \li In the \c PieGraph class, declare a \c pieSeries property.

        \dots
        \snippet 2d/quickwidgetgraphs/piegraph.h 0
        \dots

    \li Create functions for adding, removing, exploding slices, and clearing
        pie series.

        \dots
        \snippet 2d/quickwidgetgraphs/piegraph.h 1
        \dots

    \li Instantiate a pie series and add several slices in your constructor.

        \dots
        \snippet 2d/quickwidgetgraphs/piegraph.cpp 0
        \dots

    \li The \c appendSlice function creates a \l QPieSlice, sets some of its
        properties and then appends it to the pie series.

        Notice that even if you have set labels visibility to \c true, this does
        not work on slices added later to the pie series. You need to set
        visibility to \c true on creation for every added slice.

        \snippet 2d/quickwidgetgraphs/piegraph.cpp 1

    \li In the \c removeSlice function, call \l QPieSeries::remove().

    \li In the \c explodeSlices function, loop through all slices and set
        \l QPieSlice::setExploded() to \c true or \c false depending on current
        state.

    \li In the \c clearSeries function, call \l QPieSeries::clear(). This will
        delete all slices from your pie series. Note that this function does not
        delete a pie series itself.
    \endlist

    \section1 Declare a GraphView in Qml

    Declare a \l GraphsView element and set the \l {GraphsView::}{seriesList}
    property to a pie series created in C++ code.

    To customize the GraphsView theme, set a custom \l GraphsTheme.
