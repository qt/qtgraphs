 * \class Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem
 * \inmodule QtGraphs
 * \ingroup graphs_3D_widgets
 * \brief The Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem class provides methods for rendering 3D surface plots.
 *
 * This class enables developers to render 3D surface plots and to view them by
 * rotating the scene freely. The visual properties of the surface such as draw
 * mode and shading can be controlled via QSurface3DSeries.
 *
 * The Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem supports selection by showing a highlighted ball on the data
 * point where the user has clicked with the left mouse button (when the default
 * input handler is in use) or selected via QSurface3DSeries. The selection pointer
 * is accompanied by a label, which in the default case shows the value of the data
 * point and the coordinates of the point.
 *
 * The value range and the label format shown on the axis can be controlled
 * through QValue3DAxis.
 *
 * To rotate the graph, hold down the right mouse button and move the mouse.
 * Zooming is done using the mouse wheel. Both actions assume the default input
 * handler is in use.
 *
 * If no axes are set explicitly for Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem, temporary default axes with no
 * labels are created. These default axes can be modified via axis accessors,
 * but as soon as any axis is set explicitly for the orientation, the default
 * axis for that orientation is destroyed.
 *
 * \section1 How to construct a minimal Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem graph
 *
 * First, construct Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem. Since we are running the graph as a top-level
 * window in this example, we need to clear the \c Qt::FramelessWindowHint flag,
 * which is set by default:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 0
 *
 * Now Q3DSurfaceWidgetItem is ready to receive data to be rendered. Create data elements
 * to receive values:
 *
 * \note In the new proxy-series relationship, data is held in series.
 * Therefore, for the proxy to be able to add, delete, or edit the data, it is
 * a prerequisite to create a series first.
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 1
 *
 * First feed the data to the row elements and then add their pointers to the
 * data element:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 2
 *
 * Create a new series and set data to it:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 3
 *
 * Finally you will need to set it visible:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 4
 *
 * The complete code needed to create and display this graph is:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_q3dsurface_construction.cpp 5
 *
 * And this is what those few lines of code produce:
 *
 * \image q3dsurface-minimal.png
 *
 * The scene can be rotated, zoomed into, and a surface point can be selected to
 * view its position, but no other interactions are included in this minimal code
 * example. You can learn more by familiarizing yourself with the examples
 * provided, like the \l{Surface Graph Gallery}.
