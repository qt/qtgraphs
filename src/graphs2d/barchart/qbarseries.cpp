    \brief The QBarSeries class presents data in bar graphs.

    This class draws data by default as a series of bars grouped by category,
    with one bar per category from each bar set added to the series.
    It also supports horizontal bars and grouping bars as stacked.

    A bar series needs the GraphsView x-axis to be set to a BarCategoryAxis and
    the y-axis set to ValueAxis.

    The unit of width is the unit of the x-axis. The minimum width for bars is zero, and negative

    screen is one pixel regardless of the scale of the x-axis. Bars wider than zero are scaled
    using the x-axis scale.

    By default, the barWidth is 0.5 (bars will take 50% of the available width).
    The valid values range from 0.0 (0%) to 1.0 (100%).

    \note When used with QBarSeries, this value specifies the width of a group of bars instead of
